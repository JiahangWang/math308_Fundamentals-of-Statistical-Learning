    "**High-Frequency Components**: In image, noise and fine details are often high-frequency components. These components are captured by singular vectors corresponding to smaller singular values.

    "**Distribution of Singular Values**: The largest singular values capture the most prominent features of the image, such as edges and broad areas of contrast, which are critical for recognizing the main subjects and shapes within the image. As we move to smaller singular values, the details they capture become less about the essential structure of the image and more about subtle variations in texture and color, including noise. The gray haze or noise we observe is due to these subtle variations not being fully captured or separated from the image until we include a large number of singular values in the approximation.\n",

    "**Nature of Image Noise**: Image noise can arise from various sources, including the original capture process and the inherent texture of the subjects. This noise is not uniformly distributed and can be spatially complex, requiring a high level of detail to accurately represent. Since SVD captures details in order of their energy contribution to the image, the nuanced, less energy-dominant noise patterns only get accurately reconstructed when a high number of singular values and vectors are included.\n",

    "The persistence of gray haze and random background noise until high ranks in SVD-based image approximations is due to the nature of noise as a high-frequency, low-energy component that is intricately distributed across the image. Accurately capturing and removing this noise requires incorporating a large number of the finer, less significant singular values and vectors into the reconstruction, which only happens at higher ranks."
